# Morph-Detection-system-using-Machine-Learning
This project is a Python-based deep learning application that detects whether a video contains morphed faces or original faces. A user-friendly Tkinter GUI allows users to upload videos and view the classification result, along with a labeled visualization video.
 Face Morph Detection System

 üß† Face Morph Detection System
A deep learning-based desktop application that detects whether a video contains morphed (fake) or original faces using VGG16 + PCA + SVM, with a GUI built using Tkinter.

üìÅ Features
Face detection using Haar cascades
Feature extraction using VGG16 (transfer learning)
PCA for dimensionality reduction
SVM for classification
Frame-by-frame analysis
Final decision using majority voting
Video visualization with face classification labels
User-friendly Tkinter GUI
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-learn (PCA, SVM)
Tkinter (GUI)
VGG16 (for CNN feature extraction)
üß™ How It Works
Extracts frames from the uploaded video.
Detects faces in each frame.
Extracts CNN features using VGG16.
Reduces features using PCA.
Classifies each face using a trained SVM model.
Majority voting determines whether the video is morphed or original.
Outputs a labeled visualization video.
